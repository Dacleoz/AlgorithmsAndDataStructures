Exercises solved for the course of "Algorithms and data structures" in the University of Udine
## String Period 
The purpose is to calculate the fractional period of a string with two differet algorithms and calculate the resolution time with a set of randomly generated strings with a given error.
The first algorithm **periodNaive** has O(n^2) complessity.
The second algorithm **periodSmart** has Theta(n) complessity.

## Trees
The purpose is to implement different type of trees (**AVL,BST,RBT**) and calculate the time required to run the operations of research and insert using nodes randomly created
