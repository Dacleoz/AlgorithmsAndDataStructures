## String Period 
The purpose is to calculate the fractional period of a string with two differet algorithms and calculate the resolution time with a set of randomly generated strings.
The first algorithm **periodNaive** has O(n^2) complessity.
The second algorithm **periodSMart** has Theta(n) complessit.
